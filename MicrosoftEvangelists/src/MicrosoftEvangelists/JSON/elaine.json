    "bio": "I am a Technical Evangelist within the Developer Experience Group (DX) at Microsoft based in Melbourne. Prior to joining Microsoft I spent a lot of time in the deep depths of SharePoint and Office 365 including becoming a MCM in SharePoint and an Office Servers and Services MVP for 7 years. I’ve worked for large consultancies including Empired and OBS and also spent some time working on the Nintex workflow product way back when it was getting started. Hence I know a fair bit about infrastructure, SQL , authentication and all the other fun things you learn getting SharePoint running at large scale.  More recently I have been focussed on O365 and Azure including  using things like the graph API to grab data from Office 365 into apps in Azure , playing with the new SharePoint Framework and it’s toolchain and building some Bots both standalone and integrating in with Microsoft Teams. Plus I’ve also been lucky enough to travel around a bit and present at a bunch of conferences which is something I have found very enjoyable and rewarding.",
