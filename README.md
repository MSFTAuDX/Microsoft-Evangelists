# Microsoft-Evangelists
Source code for a website that lists Microsoft Technical Evangelsts and MVPs. Currently focussed on AU evangelists but can be expanded.

Written in ASP.net Core 1.0 and driven off a DocumentDB account that stores JSON that is embedded in the solution.

The original UK site is at [aka.ms/TechnicalSpeakers](http://aka.ms/TechnicalSpeakers)
